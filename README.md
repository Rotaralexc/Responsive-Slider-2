Slider Carousel design using HTML, CSS and Javascript with extremely cool effects, along with the most outstanding and complete functions of a slider:

- Allows manipulation of navigation buttons to change the displayed image.
- A horizontal bar used to count down the running time of an animation.
- Creating an endless loop helps users click next forever but will never run out of sliders.
- And automatically switch slider after specified time.
- This design has also been made Responsive so it works well on different screens.
